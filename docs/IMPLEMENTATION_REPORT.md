## Technical Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: S3 Private Bucket Access from EKS

**Problem**: Application pods needed access to private S3 bucket for background images while maintaining security best practices.

**Solution Implemented**:
```yaml
# IAM Service Account approach
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: clo835-sa
  namespace: clo835
  annotations:
    eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn: arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT:role/clo835-s3-access-role

# Pod specification
spec:
  serviceAccountName: clo835-sa
  containers:
  - name: webapp
    env:
    - name: AWS_ROLE_ARN
      value: "arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT:role/clo835-s3-access-role"
    - name: AWS_WEB_IDENTITY_TOKEN_FILE
      value: "/var/run/secrets/eks.amazonaws.com/serviceaccount/token"
```

**Alternative Approach**: Used Kubernetes secrets with AWS credentials for simplicity in educational environment:
```bash
kubectl create secret generic aws-secret \
  --from-literal=AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=$AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID \
  --from-literal=AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=$AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY \
  -n clo835
```

**Lessons Learned**: 
- IAM roles for service accounts (IRSA) provide better security
- Kubernetes secrets are simpler for development environments
- Both approaches require proper IAM policy configuration

### Challenge 2: ECR Authentication in GitHub Actions

**Problem**: GitHub Actions workflow needed to authenticate with ECR and push Docker images securely.

**Initial Approach Issues**:
- ECR login tokens expire after 12 hours
- Static credentials in GitHub secrets were problematic
- Docker build context needed optimization

**Solution Implemented**:
```yaml
# GitHub Actions workflow optimization
- name: Configure AWS credentials
  uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4
  with:
    aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
    aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
    aws-region: ${{ secrets.AWS_REGION }}

- name: Login to Amazon ECR
  id: login-ecr
  uses: aws-actions/amazon-ecr-login@v2

- name: Build and push Docker image
  env:
    ECR_REGISTRY: ${{ steps.login-ecr.outputs.registry }}
    ECR_REPOSITORY: ${{ secrets.ECR_REPOSITORY }}
    IMAGE_TAG: ${{ github.sha }}
  run: |
    docker build -t $ECR_REGISTRY/$ECR_REPOSITORY:$IMAGE_TAG .
    docker push $ECR_REGISTRY/$ECR_REPOSITORY:$IMAGE_TAG
    docker tag $ECR_REGISTRY/$ECR_REPOSITORY:$IMAGE_TAG $ECR_REGISTRY/$ECR_REPOSITORY:latest
    docker push $ECR_REGISTRY/$ECR_REPOSITORY:latest
```

**Key Improvements**:
- Used official AWS GitHub Actions for better security
- Implemented proper image tagging strategy
- Added cache optimization for faster builds

### Challenge 3: EKS LoadBalancer Configuration

**Problem**: EKS LoadBalancer service was not provisioning Application Load Balancer correctly.

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- AWS Load Balancer Controller not installed
- IAM permissions insufficient for ALB creation
- Security group configuration blocking traffic

**Solution Steps**:
1. **Install AWS Load Balancer Controller**:
```bash
# Add Helm repository
helm repo add eks https://aws.github.io/eks-charts

# Install controller
helm install aws-load-balancer-controller eks/aws-load-balancer-controller \
  -n kube-system \
  --set clusterName=clo835-cluster \
  --set serviceAccount.create=false \
  --set serviceAccount.name=aws-load-balancer-controller
```

2. **Configure Service with Annotations**:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: webapp-service
  namespace: clo835
  annotations:
    service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-type: "nlb"
    service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-scheme: "internet-facing"
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  selector:
    app: webapp
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 81
    protocol: TCP
```

3. **Update Security Groups**:
```bash
# Allow HTTP traffic from internet
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress \
  --group-id $SECURITY_GROUP_ID \
  --protocol tcp \
  --port 80 \
  --cidr 0.0.0.0/0
```

### Challenge 4: MySQL Data Persistence

**Problem**: MySQL data was lost when pods were deleted or restarted.

**Analysis**:
- PersistentVolume not properly bound
- Storage class configuration issues
- Pod affinity problems with EBS volumes

**Solution Implemented**:
```yaml
# Proper PVC configuration
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pvc
  namespace: clo835
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  storageClassName: gp2
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 3Gi

# MySQL deployment with proper volume mounting
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql-deployment
  namespace: clo835
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:8.0
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-secret
              key: DBPWD
        - name: MYSQL_DATABASE
          value: employees
        volumeMounts:
        - name: mysql-storage
          mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
          name: mysql
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pvc
```

**Validation Process**:
```bash
# Test data persistence
kubectl exec -it mysql-pod -n clo835 -- mysql -u root -p -e "INSERT INTO employees.employee VALUES ('test', 'Test', 'User', 'Testing', 'Cloud');"
kubectl delete pod mysql-pod -n clo835
kubectl wait --for=condition=ready pods -l app=mysql -n clo835
kubectl exec -it mysql-pod -n clo835 -- mysql -u root -p -e "SELECT * FROM employees.employee WHERE emp_id='test';"
```

### Challenge 5: ConfigMap Updates and Pod Refresh

**Problem**: Updating ConfigMap didn't automatically refresh application configuration.

**Root Cause**: 
- Kubernetes doesn't restart pods when ConfigMaps change
- Application cached environment variables at startup
- No mechanism for runtime configuration updates

**Solutions Evaluated**:

1. **Manual Pod Restart** (Implemented):
```bash
kubectl rollout restart deployment/webapp-deployment -n clo835
```

2. **ConfigMap Hash Annotation** (Alternative):
```yaml
# Add ConfigMap hash to deployment template
template:
  metadata:
    annotations:
      checksum/config: {{ include (print $.Template.BasePath "/configmap.yaml") . | sha256sum }}
```

3. **Sidecar Pattern** (Future Enhancement):
- Implement configuration watcher sidecar
- Automatic application restart on config changes

**Current Implementation**:
The manual restart approach was chosen for simplicity and reliability in the educational context.
