- [x] Implement proper versioning/tagging strategy
- [x] Add build status monitoring

### 6. Optional Deployment Automation
- [x] Create optional EKS deployment workflow

- [x] Implement rollback capabilities

## Rules & Tips

### GitHub Actions Best Practices
- Use official actions where possible (actions/checkout, actions/setup-python)
- Cache dependencies to speed up builds
- Use matrix builds for testing multiple Python versions if needed
- Separate build and deploy stages
- Use proper secret management
- Add meaningful job names and descriptions

### Docker Best Practices
- Use multi-stage builds for production
- Minimize layers and image size
- Use specific base image tags
- Run containers as non-root user
- Add health checks

### ECR Integration
- Tag images with commit SHA, branch name, and latest
- Use proper AWS authentication (prefer OIDC when possible)
- Include image scanning for vulnerabilities
- Implement proper cleanup policies

### Testing Strategy
- Create unit tests for critical application functions
- Test database connectivity with mocked environment
- Test S3 integration with mocked AWS services
- Include linting and code formatting checks

### Security Considerations
- Never commit secrets to repository
- Use GitHub secrets for all sensitive data
- Scan Docker images for vulnerabilities
- Validate Kubernetes manifests
- Use minimal privilege principles
